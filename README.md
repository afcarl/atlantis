Atlantis
========

Python library for atmospheric, oceanographic and hydrographic data management
analysis and visualization.

According to Wikipedia:

    Atlantis (in Greek, Ἀτλαντὶς νῆσος, "island of Atlas") is a legendary 
    island first mentioned in Plato's dialogues Timaeus and Critias, written 
    about 360 BC. According to Plato, Atlantis was a naval power lying "in 
    front of the Pillars of Hercules" that conquered many parts of Western 
    Europe and Africa 9,000 years before the time of Solon, or approximately 
    9600 BC. After a failed attempt to invade Athens, Atlantis sank into the 
    ocean "in a single day and night of misfortune".

This softwares is intended to apply the "don't repeat yourself" (DRY) principle
to atmosphere, ocean and hydrology scientists, and reduce time spent developing
code to analyse and make diagrams speak. It makes use of code from different
sources and references are given to them where appropriate.
